# Today Journal
A simple app where a person can blog about a few things that happen during the day. It also records weather! Done in Swift. Used Parse. Inspired by Viacom Labs.

# Possible Improvements
- Sort the journal posts by weekly sections instead of all posts in just one section.
- Possibility to pick a mood to attach to a post such as 'Happy', 'Mad','Tired',etc.
- Option to change between farenheight and celsius temperature. 

# Known Issues
- This was my first working app that was done in Swift. So I'm sure I didn't do everything 100%, if you come across an issue, please let me know so I can learn something!

# Strech Goals
- Watch App.

# Backend & Data Store
The backend of this app is Parse. For more information on how Parse works, check out their website Parse.com
